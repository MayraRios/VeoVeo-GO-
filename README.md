# VeoVeo-GO-
This game has been created to help those mothers a little during the lock down. It's about bringing the old game called VEO VEO (I SEE I SEE) to the digital era. Given a letter you have to guess a word. That word is the name of the object to search among the scattered markers in the room. Also has educational capsules on COVID-19. 
It has been a long way for mothers and I hope this is another online entertainment and educational resource for kids.
